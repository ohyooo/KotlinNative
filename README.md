# KotlinNative Demo

This repository is a Kotlin/Native demo. It compiles Kotlin/Native code into Android native shared libraries (`.so`) and packages them into an Android app.

## What This Demo Shows

- Kotlin/Native shared library builds for Android ABIs.
- Packaging the native libraries into the Android app.
- A simple Compose UI that calls into native code.

## Project Structure

- `shared/`: Kotlin Multiplatform module that produces `libshared.so`.
- `android/`: Android app module that packages and loads the native libraries.

## How It Works (High Level)

- The `shared` module builds Kotlin/Native shared libraries for Android targets.
- The `android` module copies those `.so` outputs into `jniLibs`.
- The app invokes native functions exposed by `libshared.so`.

## Build

Android

```sh
./gradlew :android:assembleRelease
```

Windows

```sh
./gradlew :shared:runDebugExecutableMingwX64
```

## Run Main.kt As Native

`shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/Main.kt` can also be built and run as a native program (host target).
Use the standard Kotlin/Native executable tasks generated by the `shared` module.

## Notes

- On Android native, TLS is not supported because this demo uses Ktor CIO.
- This is a demo project intended for learning and experimentation.

## Acknowledgements

- This README and parts of the setup were created with help from an AI assistant (OpenAI Codex).
